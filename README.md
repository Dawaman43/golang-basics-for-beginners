## About
This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Go code examples, tutorials, and exercises. It covers essential topics such as variables, data types, functions, control structures, slices, maps, and basic concurrency. Each example is well-commented to explain the code and concepts in detail, making it easy for beginners to follow along.

The goal is to provide a practical introduction to Go, focusing on its simplicity, performance, and modern features. The repository is inspired by resources like [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) and the official [Go documentation](https://go.dev/doc/).

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, you'll need to set up a Go development environment and clone this repository to your local machine. Follow the steps below to dive in!

## Prerequisites
- **Go**: You need Go installed on your machine (version 1.16 or later is recommended).
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Go extension, [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/), or any other editor of your choice).
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (helpful but not required).

## Installation
1. **Install Go**:
   - Download and install Go from the [official Go website](https://go.dev/dl/).
   - Follow the [installation instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install) for your operating system.
   - Verify the installation by running:
     ```bash
     go version
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dawaman43/golang-basics-for-beginners.git
   cd golang-basics-for-beginners
   ```

3. **Set Up Go Modules**:
   - This repository uses Go modules. Ensure you're in the project directory and run:
     ```bash
     go mod init github.com/Dawaman43/golang-basics-for-beginners
     ```
   - Install any dependencies (if applicable):
     ```bash
     go mod tidy
     ```

## Usage
- Navigate to the `examples/` directory to explore individual Go files, each focusing on a specific concept (e.g., `variables.go`, `functions.go`, `slices.go`).
- Run an example using the `go run` command. For example:
  ```bash
  go run examples/variables.go
  ```
- Each file contains comments explaining the code. Feel free to modify the code and experiment to deepen your understanding.
- Check the `exercises/` directory for practice problems with solutions provided in the `solutions/` directory.
